# Fluo Connection properties
############################

# NOTE - All properties that have a default are set with it.  Uncomment
# a property if you want to use a value different than the default. 
# Properties that have no default are uncommented and must be set by
# the user.

## Zookeeper connection string specifying host and chroot where Fluo stores data.
## A chroot directory suffix must be specified but doesn't need to be named
## '/fluo'.  If not specified, a Fluo application cannot be initialized.
#fluo.connection.zookeepers=localhost/fluo
## Zookeeper timeout
#fluo.connection.zookeeper.timeout=30000
## Connection retry timeout (in milliseconds). Set to -1 to retry forever.
#fluo.connection.retry.timeout.ms=-1
## Set this property before initialization and Fluo will lock down all zookeeper
## using this secret.  After initialization, the same secret must always be
## supplied for any connection or services.  If not set, then all data in
## zookeeper will be world readable.  It's a good idea to set this property.
## Could use the command : head -c 9 /dev/random | base64
#fluo.connection.zookeeper.secret=
