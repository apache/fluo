# Client properties
# -----------------
# Zookeeper connection string
#io.fluo.client.zookeeper.connect=localhost
# Zookeeper timeout

# Fluo uses iterators within Accumulo tablet servers, therefore Accumulo per
# table classpath need to be configured with a comma seperated list of uris
# where Accumulo can find Fluo jars.  These jars should be reachable from
# every tablet server.  For the setting below to work, FLUO_HOME must be 
# set as an environment variable during initialization.
